Simple chess project for me to practice Python.

To-do:


- [x] make player unable to move opponent pieces
- [x] print list of taken pieces
- [x] calculate score of taken pieces
- [x] make pieces unable to move on occupied fields
- [x] fix: can't capture, nor capture with backrow pieces
- [x] display previous moves *(might later add proper formatting)*
- [ ] check if move is legal. *(done for pawns except en passant)*
--> [ ] check Rooks
--> [ ] check Bishops
--> [ ] check Queen
--> [ ] check Knights
--> [ ] check King
- [ ] check if king is check
- [ ] check if king is checkmate
